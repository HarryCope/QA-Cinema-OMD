            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.</h5>  
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:</h5>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.</h5>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.</h5>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.</h5>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">4. Repeat</h5>  
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.</h5>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.</h5>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">What did we do?</h5>   
            <h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Scrum Theory</h4>   
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

              Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.
              
              Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Transparency</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Inspection</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Adaptation</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.</h5> 
            <h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Scrum Values</h4>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.</h5>

The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.</h5>  
            <h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Scrum Master</h4> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

              The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:</h5>

          <div style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 200px;padding-bottom: 30px;">
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">At the very start of undertaking this project we had our first sprint.  This began with Sprint Planning, in this first session we were able to
            outline the steps that were needed to create a minimum viable product, completion criteria and establish a working timeline.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">We would then move on to daily scrums.  These were invaluebale as they allowed us as a team to come together and provide updates and ask for support fomr our fellow team member.</h5>            
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">As we  appoached the end of the project we were able to have a Sprint Review.  During this time we were able to asses how well we were able to
            achieve the initial goals outlined in the first Sprint.  Using a trello board as a project management tool it was clear for all of us to see what were able to achieve during the two weeks we had to work on the project.</h5> 
            <h5 style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">The final element of a Sprint is the Sprint Retrospective.  following on from the review here we were able to see what parts of the project worked well and where there is room for improvement.
            When worling in a team the overall efficiency can be key to the timely completion of a task.  Any tasks that were left in the product backlog were assessed to see if they were still vaible or would need to be removed from the project.
            By doing this we were able to identfy what products we would like to add if we were given more time to conduct another Sprint, this also gave us an oppourtunity to look at what we had achieved and see if there were any areas where we could improve.</h5>
